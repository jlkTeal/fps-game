[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new

I fill in-between
Full of lies to keep
Try to make it seem
Like I'm some sort of king
I'm untrustworthy, feel a bit earthy
Thinkin' 'bout hoppin' out tha' car
Run down the road to get hit
I'll catch another bitch
I'll get another lick
With that stain on the carpet,
Something's from Target
Got my blood at the market
From a knife, is the sharpest
5 days later, the truth comes from
Another phone search, a new order come
Where was my thumb, said it was bit numb
In her pussy, wet, says it was, not yet
In a bit, he'll forget
Another way to win

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new
