I'm in an abyss, I kissed your lips
My feelings bliss, I don't take tips
I'm uncommitted, times is hitting
I'm not sitting, but committing
We won't confess, I'm a mess
I want less, take it best
50/50, work at Wendy's
You want kitty?, it's quite windy
I need pity in the city
Fuck your feelings, need it gritty

It's quite pretty[dear], did I need a[pair]?
I gon' fuck a square, when he wasn't here
Grow a pair not for here
Not for queer, we were there
In the stair, I bought where

Grow up[grow up], show up[show up]
You were never there, dissapear
You say you wanted to be
Like that's true, wasn't we?
Who said you wasn't you?
I went through, who was new?
