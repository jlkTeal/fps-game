There's killings in the streets
Whippings, pretty neat
I don't feel complete
I'll come with the heat[yea]
Meet me in the streets
Comin' with the tea
Fold a bush for free
We just need your fee
How it really be?
We kill on the concrete
When we wake up bad
Come out, it's big frat
I'm not really glad
Bitch we go down mad

Why you flat
Come with that
Eat a bat
Let's just chat

Fuck your feeling, hurt
Get another shirt
Go and eat some dirt
I'll just exert

Really killin' on the streets
They ain't pay their fee
Get another key
Fuck it up for free
Blood on the meat, blood on the beat
Killing isn't me
I'll repeat my keep

This is kind of worse
I don't have a curse
Wouldn't be the first
How much is it worth?
Sell you to the worse

So gifted at finding
Something I can't keep
Something you said was a bit steep
Something, you said "wasn't yours to keep"
Was is you?
Was it you?
Exerting my feelings, you say bad
Living with killing, you say chad?
Fuck your friendship, I meant it
You want back, just say you end it
