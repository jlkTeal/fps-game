[intro]
The 4 horsemen wanted this
They wanted us to miss
To die abliss
Now be dismissed

I'm on your neck like that cop was
You see cuz', don't need us
Kill you[up], steal you[up]
Reel you[up], meal?[you up]
I, I, eat it up
Not a gay bitch but I'll make you bluff
I'll make you puff, now pass the blunt[bitch]

The devil got ahold of me[huh]
I think I need control of me[huh]
Why you always callin' me
I really need to set you free

Take a hit, break a diss
You dismissed, get my mrs
Why you his?, I need your kids
Break your kiss, [I]needed this
Come with mrs, I will miss
The feelings bliss, in abyss
