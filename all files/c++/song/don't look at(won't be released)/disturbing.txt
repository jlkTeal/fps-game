[intro]
I'm inhuman, built by Truman
You're a new man, from a cuban
Confessing is deceitful
Why you really need full?
I don't tell the truth on this one
So why I really need to?

[I]admit it[admit it], I did it[I did it]
The sickness[the sickness], the witness[the witness]
Who did it?[who did it?], who bit it?[who bit it?]
Fuck livin'[fuck livin'], I'm killin'[I'm killin']

Kill kill kill kill
Steal steal steal steal
Steal what?, steal you
Kill you, meal?, you

Meet you, beat you
Eat you, treat?, you
This you?, tissue
Fuck you, who's new?

Fucking the body, got a new shawty
No more new bids, got no new kids
You know sarah?, that's a Tyler thing
I'm a mirror, got a styler thing
I wanna' try new things, fry new things
The body is fried, the body in mine

I'm a bit disturbing, got a new man learning
Cancel me, finacial free
Handle me, I'm cancel free
Just trying out new things, a bit disturbing

Put me in a hospital, got some new binoculars
Can see her, can't eat her
Won't free her, won't be her

The cops arn't coming, the mops are running
Too late to stop me, too late to cop me
Why remark me, I can't restart me
She's already eaten, her body on the floor
I'm begging for more, I live right next door
Fucking the door, want the bottom half more
Ate her breast, was a test
I'm sure I failed, but it won't rest
I need bail, she has a tail
A furry back that won't attack
The cops are coming, I won't take it
I'll just fake it
You'll love me bitch, or we'll both die alone
Open the door, or we'll both die a stone
You're at home, I gotta go[gunshot]
