Someday, over horizon
True, love come
When, we wake up, see the blessing
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhhh,
Somday, over horizon
See far away, a glance of hope
Ahh, ahhh, ahh, ahhhh
One day true peace come over all
We find purpose in life
When, that day come, we all experience our time
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhhhhhh
Someday, over horizon,
Ahh ahhhh ahhh
Someday, over horizon
