[intro]
Don't got nothing to confess
Don't got nothing to retest
You think I'm some sort of killa'
Like I'm some sort of thrilla'

I admit, I made it
A song of assissination
Man I'm going brainless
I'd don't know how to make it

Unreleased, got a beat
It's a heat, pretty neat
Why relive it?
Don't resit it

Repeat myself, can't leave myself
Obviously, I keep myself
The world's a big one, I just bid on
A new world to go put "mid" on

This a sick one, I'm a quick one
Got a big one, put a rig on
Put a diaond on your finger
Make a lime and lemon zinger
Crime and prime, I'll bring 
Now don't linger[around]
Please don't make a loud soud
She don't know how long it's been
So when she wakes don't take her

You see, to be seen
You must first make some big thing
I don't sing, but I bring
Properity, to the king[k.dot]

What time it is
What rhyme is it
Where crime done live
In a dime, I done drive

Sessions shorter, built with mortar
A reporter, not a supporter
