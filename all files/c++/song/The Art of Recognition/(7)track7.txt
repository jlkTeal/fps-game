[intro]
Don't got nothing to confess
Don't got nothing to retest
You think I'm some sort of killa'
Like I'm some sort of thrilla'

I admit, I made it
A song of assissination
Man I'm going brainless
I'd don't know how to make it

Unreleased, got a beat
It's a heat, pretty neat
Why relive it?
Don't resit it

Repeat myself, can't leave myself
Obviously, I keep myself
The world's a big one, I just bid on
A new world to go put "mid" on

This a sick one, I'm a quick one
Got a big one, put a rig on
Put a diaond on your finger
Make a lime and lemon zinger
Crime and prime, I'll bring 
Now don't linger[around]
Please don't make a loud soud
She don't know how long it's been
So when she wakes don't take her

You see, to be seen
You must first make some big thing
I don't sing, but I bring
Properity to the king[k.dot]

What time is it
What rhyme is it
Where crime done live
In a dime, I done drive

Sessions shorter, built with mortar
A new reporter, not a supporter
I need a minute, not a finish
Fuck the sickness, I'm gon' finish

What's the limit, I'm all in it
You don't fit it, you done bit it
Permit it, sickness, quickness, slickness
Don't wanna walk when the run is wet
Don't wanna talk when the food is next
She said no, she a hoe
She a little mentally slow

Not a drill sargent waiting on the first and the fifth
When the fourth wall was broken on in
Fucking on the van wall when
The corner store wasn't walk on in
Bodies on over bodies
Walk on in a new eye drink
When you walk to the driveway
Make sure the colors are wrecked
Make sure the pgs are back in the place where they send
Don't worry 'bout the new ivey
Just run straight into the driveway
Don't look back until ice rink
Got no ice but a ice ring
Got no lice but a nice kink
Scrub yo' head now get a new seasonal icing
Just go hop on a oby
The driver won't stop for a body
We don't need a new toddy
Obviously the new order won't want a sheet with an iced tea
track7

[chorus]
Don't go nothing to confess
track7 ain't a test
Why you trying to mess up
Everything that's unstuck

Ice cube over like a beer
A bitch with long hair, I might beat down
I need a kid to go to school like my seat now
Really fucking up my mind like forsee now
And now I'm hearing that it's really with the heat now?[bruh]
You copy the style, I copy the rhymes
You taking a mile, I'm taking the time
Why we comparing how dangerous is your mind
Because mine now is scary, how?
Wow wow wow wow
Never knew you liked it now
Where's your fucking frown?[yea]
You gon' wear a gown[yea]
Get your name out of town[yea]
I'm gon' get a fucking pound[yea]

1984, nineteen with a tour
That's pretty secure[yea]
That's pretty pure[yea]
Pretty cold, I'm a mold
You got 20 ones?
You got 41s?
40s' go pretty hard
I'm gon' go pretty far
Driving in my fucking car
