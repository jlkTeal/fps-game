[intro]
This is me, who am I
Why am I?, what is I?
Take a right, take your time
Don't revise, don't rerhyme
Take your time, take your time

I go out gracious, not so painless
Not so fakeless, not so make it[make it]
I do this for the feelings, the emotions
The remotions, the mixed potions
This my last try, you a last high
You a nice lie, you the far cry

This the ending, the beginning
The remending of the trending
Why you care?
This ain't fair
This aware, not a care
I ain't there for you dear

[chorus]
This is me, who am I
Why am I?, what is I?
Take a right, take your time
Don't revise, don't rerhyme
Take your time, take your time
I'm new, it's new, renew, free who?

Just pretend for an end, I'm gon' lend
You a little sation, go and farm, for your harm
These women really trippin', I respect them, go and get them
Took my pen and started writing, evident?
I took attemps, I couldn't win, writing isn't it
Take these pills just to write with counterfeit[isn't it]

You're upset, you got no friends, you just a threat, a little kid
I know it's a little mid, little bit
Without a net, who'm I gon' get
In just a bit, he'll admit
He gon' scream, not gon' cream without a team

[chorus]
This is me, who am I
Why am I?, what is I?
Take a right, take your time
Don't revise, don't rerhyme
Take your time, take your time

Almost see through, gonna be you
Got to eat through, got to be you
Am I honest?, am I modest?
You're dishonest, did you promise?[no]
No, you a little low
Show, though, get it do you know?

Do you really know?
How you really shoW?
Do you really really really want to know?
You see me and it really goes like this
