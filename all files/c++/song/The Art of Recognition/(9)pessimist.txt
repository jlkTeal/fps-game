i see through lies bitch

both leave hurt just to catch you a nerd
both eat dirt just to watch that's absurd

why you trippin'

why you go around don't fix it
why you keep it in my face bitch I can't fix it

[chorus]
I know i'm wrong, I know i'm right
so please don't fight, please don't fight
treat the women, mistreat biches
mistreat biches, mistreat biches
