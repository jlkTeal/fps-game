[intro]
I said I wouldn't anymore
You said too late
I say I won't anymore
You say
You say
You say

I was just another guy
40 of 'em now?
Oh no 41
41

42 or I?
I
I

Going to school
Come home to get yelled at
Worrin' about girls
You'd think me a fool

Inflation, patience
Going brainless
Got into fights, got my ass beat
Take me out of class, get my ass beat[last week]
Last week

Akward, hot
Got no where to jot
Foolin' 'round at home
Get yelled at, bailed at

Shreveport
Igor?
Flee gore
Free whore

Going crazy when?
Why you fakin', been
Drinkin all the gin
Get the tapes off
Take the vapes off
Take the whole half fuckin capes off
Bitch you not a hero
Bitch you have a zero

This a murduris' system
Not trying to get into this
Not like empathy
Not for sympathy
Not like this about to set me free
Just listen, dont list em

Explain emotions, explain your focus
Don't get lotion, get your
Get your

Get your bitch ass out
Your mom dont want you
Bitch no one wants you
You gon' die lonely
I'm praying on your downfall[bitch]

Don't go pout
Don't go out
It's hard loving you
It's hard, fuckin' you

Man it's hard, no one loves you
No one fucks you
You hate it, you fucking hate it
You know it won't work
You know you won't work

I know I'm wrong
I know what I've done to get here
Don't blame it on her
You're wrong too

This is I
This is me
