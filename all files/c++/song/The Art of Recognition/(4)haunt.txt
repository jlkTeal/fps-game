[intro]
Everything you do comes back to haunt you
You know that, I know that, we know that

Don't live in school, I'm not a fool
Why got to be here, not i'm not the cool
These kids' a fool, they got to drool
Got these rules, why'm I a tool

Revolution, not a solution
Setbacks happen, just evolution
Why listen to a kid, he's just a bid
Bid on him, a bit mid

[chorus]
Haunt you, jail you
Make a future, review ya'
Who you are isn't you
Why into, you

Why why why why
Just get another guy[why]
Just don't say why[why]
Why say just, that's a must[why]

No more questions
No suggestions
Get a lesson, not to mess in

Get get get get
Just a get, for a bit
Why you knit?, why you lie
Get a kit, for a supply

I I I I
4 Is' for the sleeping eye
Fucking on this thot but the bitch is bi
Why you always want to die

[chorus]
Haunt you, jail you
Make a future, review ya'
Who you are isn't you
Why into, you

This is short, don't report

I'm a jpeg, almost nameless
Just rename it, can't I face it
That's pretty hot, man it's sunny
You thought wrong, pretty funny
I'm not saying he's nameless, I respect it
I'm just saying it's crazy how to subject it
Don't correct it, it's repsective
I'm relentless, don't expect it

Brace yourself I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
If the shooter wasn't here so keep you down for the pain
Cover the days, keep is astray
Down for the play, but not today
Aye aye aye, go away
It's pretty late, you're pretty gay

It's too late, it's already here
You're too late, I'm full of fear
The world cold as shit
I've been doing more rock and this shit ain't it

Fear fear fear fear
Go in your fucking ear
I'm living in the air
Haunting you, wanting you
Killing you, feeling you

[chorus]
Haunt you, jail you
Make a future, review ya'
Who you are isn't you
Why into, you
