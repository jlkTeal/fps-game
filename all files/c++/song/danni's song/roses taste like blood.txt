[chorus]
God is on the phone
Pick it up, will ya'?
I think nascar ain't quicka
I'll roll out a bit, now will ya'?

Roses, roses, roses, roses
Fucking it up, I'm living with oprah
Cannot discuss, I'm born on Europa
We died for ages, we don't get pages
Fucking your world up, we're living in cages
I don't get saving, you're not behaving
Why don't you save it, why don't you hate it

Danni da betty, was born not petty
Like a bit of roses, eat it, leave with it
Nascar drive fast, run out, fuck with it
I can't be doing this now
Cops outside, do what I want
What is like 55 hundred a month?
What is the bacon to eggs, is enough?

[chorus]
God is on the phone
Pick it up, will ya'?
I think nascar ain't quicka
I'll roll out a bit, now will ya'?

Got a bit of flowers, now will ya'?
Life is amazing, I'm sniffing, I'm crazy
I'm fucking, I'm aiming
Like roses, I'm waiting
For the right month, for the right bunch
For another road to live on, lunch
For another code to put in, punch
For another mode to play now, hunch
For another flower to relive, pinch it
Girls need past, now fuck her with it
I need gas, now pay or fix it
Slideshow for the nightshow, can't visit
Flowers been taking, my vision
Roses taste like blood, can't witness

She my little baddie, she my little cool
I don't wanna fuck for, I wan' go to school
What this really been for?, what I really do
Why this really fucked up, leave it up to you
Develop feelings, wanna keep to you
I don't wanna fuck up, I'm gon' be with you

[chorus]
God is on the phone
Pick it up, will ya'?
I think nascar ain't quicka
I'll roll out a bit, now will ya'?

You know anything 'bout flowers?
Now it's been a couple hours
Will you go and grab the flour
Bake a cake now will ya'?
In a bit I'll kill ya'
From the seeds to the new law,
Something might be lil raw
Roses taste like blood, will be, ah
[It's for ya']
[Something will be, with ya']

I'm a bit petty, from in ya'
Woman with a vissa'
Come an get it reala'
I don't really feel ya'
Understand the roses
I just need to focus
Cannot really hold ya'
Running with a mota'

[chorus]
God is on the phone
Pick it up, will ya'?
I think nascar ain't quicka
I'll roll out a bit, now will ya'?
