I'm in an abyss, I kissed your lips
My feelings bliss, I take tips
I'm uncommitted, need it fitted
Not your dress, but a mess
I want less, take it best
50/50, work at Wendy's
You want kitty?, it's quite windy
I need pity in the city

It's quite pretty[dear], did I need a[pair]?
I gon' fuck a square, when he wasn't here
