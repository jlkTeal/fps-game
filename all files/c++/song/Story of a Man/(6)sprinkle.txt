I had a friend, a really good friend
I would mend at only extend
He would defend his only partner
I would want to take it, smarter
She was queen for the teen
In beetween all the green, was a little make believe
They broke up over, a little bit naive
She was looking at another boy, her ex [you]may say
She was his little toy, years ago today[hey]
So he got mad, a little sad
Was depressed without a test
Wasn't glad, not for the freedom
A new best was for one, need 'em

He was a bit older, needed closure
They got back together, he was happy now
Got exposure, but he was happy how?
A little leave made him almost kill himself
When he really feels himself, he will almost deal himself
He won't believe, not what he sees
He won't recieve, not what is ease
