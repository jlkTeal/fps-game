[intro]
I can't see here, why I need to be here
If I can't see clear, then what appear
It'll appear, it'll appear
I CAN'T SEE CLEAR, I CAN'T BE NEAR[you]

You got a virus, white iris
Get your flowers, like Cyrus
Won a grammy, but what you gonna hand me?
See you in Miami, my hands kind of clammy
With that virus I can't see
What is your reality
Will I live or will I be
Just another sight to see

I can't see what I can't be
When were we, such a thing
I'm a king, bring my ring
I said bring my ring, I mean my wing
I can't fly what I can't ride
I ride what I provide[BITCH]

Realization, I displace it
Why you waitin', I might fake it
I'll fake the release, I'll get on my knees
I'll suck your dick to get a release
Clip that, now I have an increase

I thought I'd get on their good sides
See where I am now...

I fucked up, I fucked up
Why run up, you cuck up
I got stuck, I need luck
The end must, repent us
Kill me, don't reel me[done]

I got 3 albums lined up, that's why you can't find us
Three piece without the linna', you can fuck around and find a
New place to out wind ya', keep it without kinda
Kind of store with a minda'[like]
I will find ya', a new rida'
